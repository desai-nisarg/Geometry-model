The repo contains code to analyze the effect of territory size on intergroup mortality on simulated agents, chimpanzees, and wolves. Analysis techniques employed include Poisson Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Poisson Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) and Information Theoretic Model Selction using QAICc. 

Data sources:\
Simulated agents: data obtained from simulations performed using the agent-based model [LethalGemoetry](https://github.com/kncrouse/LethalGeometry) developed by [Kristin N. Crouse](https://github.com/kncrouse)\
Chimpanzees: data from from 18 different chimpanzee communities in long-term study sites across Africa compiled by [Wilson et al., 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13727)\
Wolves: data from long-term behavioral observations of gray wolves from Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming [Cassidy et al., 2015](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/26/5/1352/242442)

Data available at reasonable request to Kristin N. Crouse (crou0048[at]umn[dot]edu)
